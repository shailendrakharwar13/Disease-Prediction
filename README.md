# Heart-Disease-Prediction

Predicting and diagnosing heart disease is the biggest challenge in the medical industry and relies on factors such as the physical examination, symptoms and signs of the patient.

Factors that influence heart disease are body cholesterol levels, smoking habit and obesity, family history of illnesses, blood pressure, and work environment. Machine learning algorithms play an essential and precise role in the prediction of heart disease.
